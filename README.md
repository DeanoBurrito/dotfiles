# Dotfiles

My current dotfiles and system setup, intended for use on nixos-unstable. I honestly dont recommend you use these yourself, this is set-up how I like things, but maybe you can find inspiration or learn something here.

The contents of `nixos-config` should be copied to `/etc/nixos/` on the host system, and `home-config` should be copied into your home directory.
